This is a simple hotel booking application. We have created a hotel booking application using React, NodeJS, and MongoDB. We are fetching all the data from MongoDB using the backend API

How to run the project
Open a new terminal. Navigate to the API folder and run the “npm start” command. This starts the backend. While this is running open another terminal and navigate to the client folder. Run the same command in this terminal. This starts the front end and opens the link to the application
